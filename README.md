# DES-DNA
#**DNA-Triple DES Encryption Algorithm**
## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of a university course, introduces an innovative encryption algorithm that combines the Data Encryption Standard (DES) with DNA computing and integrates Triple DES and Huffman compression to enhance data security.

## Key Features
### DNA-Based Encryption: 
Utilizes the principles of DNA computing to encode data, leveraging the complexity and randomness inherent in DNA sequences.
### Triple DES Integration: 
Adds a layer of security by implementing Triple DES, making the encryption more resistant to attacks compared to the standard DES.
### Huffman Compression: 
Incorporates Huffman compression to minimize data size and further obfuscate the plaintext, providing an additional security measure.
### Novel Contributions
The project's main novelty lies in the combination of DNA-based encryption with Triple DES and Huffman compression. This hybrid approach significantly improves the encryption strength and reduces the potential for cryptanalysis.

## How to Use
### Input: 
Provide the plaintext message to be encrypted.
### Processing: 
The algorithm converts the plaintext into DNA sequences, applies Triple DES encryption, and compresses the output using Huffman coding.
### Output: 
An encrypted and compressed ciphertext that is highly secure against various cryptographic attacks.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an innovative approach to encryption by combining DNA computing principles with classical cryptographic techniques, enhancing security and performance.
